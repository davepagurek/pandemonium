## Why

The panorama feature on early smartphones produced frequent delightful visual glitches. Modern panorama apps are better at accurately reproducing their subjects, and subsequently forget their true goal: surprising the user with the unexpected and uncanny. We propose a novel camera system that maximizes occurrences of weird visuals rather than trying to sweep them under the rug.
